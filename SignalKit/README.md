## Lights: Controller and Output

The idea was to build on previous work and add controls. A slider for adjusting lights came to mind and this is what i ended up with. There is room for improvement - I tried to change hue, invert colors, and experiment with introducing randomness. But that was deviating too much from the assignment and keeping variables in control was becoming a challenge. All in all, im happy with how blur (changed using signal.floatValue) aand opacity (using signal.toggleValue) create this nice effect
